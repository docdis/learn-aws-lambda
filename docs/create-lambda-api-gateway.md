# 'HELLO WORLD!' Example (API Gateway)
Another really cool thing about AWS Lambda is that you can invoke a Lambda function through a web endpoint i.e. they can be triggered via HTTP calls. You can configure these endpoints straight from the AWS Lambda console:

1. Open your AWS Lambda console and click on the function that you wish to create an endpoint for. _(If you haven't created a Lambda function already you can do so by following one of the previous examples!)_

1. On this page Select the 'API endpoints' tab and then click '+ Add API endpoint':

1. Configure your API endpoint settings:
   - API endpoint type: API Gateway  
   - API name: whatever-you-like (we recommend having all lower case letters separated by a dash for readability)  
   - Resource name: `/YourLambdaFunctionName`  
   - Method: `GET/POST/PUT/DELETE`...  
   - Deployment stage: Defines the *path through which an API deployment is accessible*
   - Security: Defines how your function can be invoked  
     - The path will be a URI ending in >> `.../deploymentStage/ResourceName`

   We've set our 'Security' to be 'Open with access key' because this is an example of a more common use case. These keys can be configured by following the link in the blue box. **Our example URI will end in >> `.../prod/Concatenate`**

   Click 'Submit' once you are happy with your Lambda function configuration.

1. You should now be able to see your function listed at a URL that has been generated by AWS Lambda.

1. Now let's test our endpoint to see if our Lambda function is being invoked. Go to the AWS console and then click on 'API Gateway' under Application Services. This will take you to a list of your APIs where you should see the one we just created. Click on the title.

1. Click on the METHOD beneath your Lambda function, in our case it's `POST`. Then click on the word 'TEST' with the lightning bolt underneath it:

1. Enter the input values that your API will be expecting _(this is the event object we have been using to previously test our functions)_ then click the blue 'Test' button on the right. Your response body should then return the results of your Lambda function:
